Graphite Pager
==============

Graphite Pager is a small application to send PagerDuty alerts based on
Graphite metrics. This makes it easy to be paged about what's happening in
your system.

You shouldn't uses this yet, I'm still playing with it.

It can be deployed to Heroku (make sure you use SSL!)
